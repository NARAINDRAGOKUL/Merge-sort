# Merge-sort
Report

1. **Description of each Merge Sort Version**:
   - Explain the differences between each version.
   - Detail the threshold optimization for **Take 4**.

2. **Results**:
   - Provide tables or graphs comparing the average running times for each array size and version.
   - Highlight the optimal threshold for **Take 4**.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Discuss the performance differences.
   - Explain why certain versions performed better for different array sizes.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings.
   - Provide recommendations based on the observed performance.

This approach will provide a comprehensive comparison of different merge sort implementations and their performance on large datasets.
